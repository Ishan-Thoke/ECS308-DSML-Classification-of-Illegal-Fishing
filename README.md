# ECS308-DSML-Classification-of-Illegal-Fishing
This project is part of the coursework in ECS308, Data Science and Machine Learning. Course Instructor : Dr. Tanmay Basu
<br>
Problem Statement:  The objective is to develop supervised machine learning frameworks to identify illegal fishing. 
<br>
Data: This is a dataset to build machine learning models for detecting illegal fishing events by analyzing Automatic Identification System (AIS) vessel tracks. The data and description of the data will be made available upon request.

Tasks: Identify significant features of vessel tracks to track illegal fishing events. Design novel feature selection framework  or use the existing techniques with proper justifications to identify salient features of the given data. Report the performance of different classification techniques on the training data to demonstrate that the proposed feature selection scheme is working well. You can also propose a novel classification framework for this problem. Subsequently, execute the best framework on the test data and submit the class labels in a text file. Each row of the text file will contain the class label of an instance of the test data e.g., 0 following the order of the given test data.
